ARCHITECTURAL STRATEGY:

All in all, this website contains 4 different HTML pages. That of which being named accordingly: index.html, about.html, products.html, and branches.html. As per technical constraints, this website does not make use of <div> tags but instead utilizes HTML5 elements such as headers, main, article, section, and so on and so forth so as to connect all of the 4 pages seamlessly through a navigation menu. Moreover, the images used will be separated into an images folder in order to keep the files organized and easy to access. Lastly, there was no usage of CSS to ensure cleanliness in the document outline.
